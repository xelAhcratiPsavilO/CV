I‚Äôm a software developer, graduate of Makers Academy and former aerospace and mechanical engineer. I developed a deep love of data as a technical manager at Michelin which has become an endless curiosity about coding. I get excited about cutting edge-technology solving challenges including AI and machine learning. I aim to grow and contribute to a dynamic team in a culture that values challenge and learning.

## üé≠ Skills

#### *Genuine Love for Programming*

My time at Makers allowed me to explore the limits of my curiosity and passion about code. 

A clear example of that is my final project. Before starting the project, I researched about ML and AI attending external workshops and meet-ups. Then, my teammates and I applied that knowledge to build a self-driving car which uses Machine Learning and image recognition. I wrote part of the software in Python and used Google‚Äôs framework TensorFlow on an image classifier API server that we built to communicate with a Raspberry-Pi Linux computer integrated into the chassis of the car. On top of that, I added an HTML and CSS interface, available on mobile or pc, to give instructions or activate the AI mode.   

#### *Communication*

I have developed strong communication skills at Michelin, in a role which required strong diplomacy and an ability to communicate common goals to diverse teams. I led brainstorming sessions, prepared meeting agendas and compiled post-meeting reports.  

This skill was easily extrapolable to pair programming sessions and team projects. It was specially useful during our final project at Makers allowing us to work on an Agile way when we were highly conditioned by time constraints. 

#### *Analysing & Problem - Solving*

At Michelin UK, I lead a team to efficiently extend the heating systems for the production workshop. Analysing data sets and individually tackling the problems we faced, allowed me to find the root cause and apply basic principles of thermodynamics and save 40 K in the project budget. 

#### *Group & Team-Working*

Michelin is an agile organisation and working within the agile structure I oversaw and coordinated teams of contractors. Agile practices allowed us to work within expected dates and deploy intercontinental projects that set the benchmark for Michelin worldwide. 

I highly value collective achievement and I like to share the things I learn. That is why I decided to become a mentor of 2 other students at Makers.
